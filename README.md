# Machine Learning Projects in Python

This repository contains a collection of Python projects utilizing Machine Learning techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this repository, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python (version 3.11)
- Python Libraries:
  - scikit-learn
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
